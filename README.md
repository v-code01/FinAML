# FinAML

## Introduction

FinAML (Financial Analytical Markup Language) is a cutting-edge programming language tailored for financial analysis and modeling. This documentation provides an overview of key features, syntax, and usage of FinAML, drawing inspiration from the functional programming paradigm of OCaml.

## Key Features

### 1. Functional Paradigm

FinAML embraces a functional programming paradigm, providing immutability and first-class functions for enhanced code clarity and maintainability.

### 2. Static Typing and Inference

Similar to OCaml, FinAML employs static typing and type inference to ensure robustness, catching errors at compile-time and promoting code reliability.

### 3. Expressive Syntax

FinAML features a clean and expressive syntax, minimizing boilerplate code and promoting concise expression of complex financial algorithms. The language aims to enhance productivity without compromising readability.

### 4. Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)

ADTs are a cornerstone of FinAML, enabling developers to model complex financial structures accurately, enhancing code organization and facilitating comprehensive representation of financial instruments.

### 5. Pattern Matching

Pattern matching, inspired by OCaml, is integral to FinAML, allowing developers to concisely handle various scenarios in financial data manipulation and analysis.

### 6. Native Support for Financial Operations

FinAML comes with built-in libraries tailored for financial calculations, time-series analysis, and risk modeling, reducing the need for external dependencies.

## Example Code

```finaml
(* Define a financial instrument using Algebraic Data Types *)
type financial_instrument =
  | Stock of string * float  (* Ticker symbol and current price *)
  | Bond of string * float * float  (* Ticker symbol, face value, and coupon rate *)

(* Function to calculate the present value of a financial instrument *)
let present_value = function
  | Stock (_, price) -> price
  | Bond (_, face_value, coupon_rate) -> face_value /. (1. +. coupon_rate)

(* Financial modeling example *)
let main () =
  let stock = Stock("AAPL", 150.0) in
  let bond = Bond("XYZ", 1000.0, 0.05) in

  let pv_stock = present_value stock in
  let pv_bond = present_value bond in

  Printf.printf "Present Value of Stock: $%.2f\n" pv_stock;
  Printf.printf "Present Value of Bond: $%.2f\n" pv_bond

(* Run the financial modeling example *)
let () = main ()
